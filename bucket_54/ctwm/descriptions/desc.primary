 CTWM is an X11 Window Manager. It was created by Claude Lecommandeur 
<Claude.Lecommandeur@Epfl.Ch> in 1992 as a fork of the TWM window manager.

By modern standards, it's a lightweight and fairly minimal window manager. 
It is enormously configurable however, and can be made to look as simple 
or complex as you prefer. See our Themes page for some examples.
